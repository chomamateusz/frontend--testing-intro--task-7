# Create a counter class

## TODO:

1. Counter should a ES6 module.
2. Counter should store current number in `number` variable in the module.
3. Counter should start from `0`.
4. Counter have `.inc` function that bumps the stored number by `1`.
4. Counter have `.dec` function that decreases the stored number by `1`.
5. Counter have `.reset` function overwrite that number to `0`.
